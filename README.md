# nanrsc

Naive implementation of react server components.

## Features

- [x] Server Components (async and not async)
- [x] Client Components ('use client')
- [x] Server Actions
- [ ] Router

## Install and run

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run lib/server.ts
```

## Project structure

For the moment is really badly structured

- `/lib` is the actual RSC server
- `/app` is example app code that is being served
